# Final practical

## Theme

During this week you will conduct a study on opiod use. We will conduct the steps of a typical study:

- The first day you will create and characterise the database that we are going to work with.
- The second day you will create the codelist and cohorts of interest.
- The third day you will characterise the cohorts of interest and calculate the incidence and prevalence of different opiods in your database.
- The fourth day you will conduct a Drug Utilisation Study and analyse the treatment adherence of opiods.
